# Welcome to Rise Assessment Solution!

We are excited to introduce the Rise Assessment Solution â€” a powerful tool designed to simplify your assessment workflows.

## Getting Started

To get the application up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Start the Application**  
   In the root directory of the project, run the following command to build and launch the application using Docker:
   ```bash
   npm install
   docker-compose up --build
2. **Accessing pgAdmin**
   Once the application is running, head over to your browser and open pgAdmin by visiting:
    ```bash
   http://localhost:8084
**Note:** You may need to stop any local instances of PostgreSQL and pgAdmin to avoid port conflicts.

3. **pgAdmin Setup**

   - Pick a server name of your choice.
   - Add `db` as your **host**.
   - Use `postgres` as your **password**.
   - Use `admin@example.com` as your **username**.

4. **Viewing the Database**

    After successfully logging in, navigate to the **rise_db** database to explore the tables created and the data populated within them.

5. **API Testing**

    You can test the application's endpoints using the Postman collection that was shared with you or is available in the root directory of this application.
